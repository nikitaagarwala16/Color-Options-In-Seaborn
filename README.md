# Color-Options-In-Seaborn
>The motive behind this repository is to visualize the color options that are available as palette values in searborn library.

A little about the dataset used:

*The dataset used is a public dataset on Football players.
*To visualize we are plotting bar plots.
*The bar plots indicate how the market value of footballers vary with their positions on fields.

To know the palette value for any plot refer to the plot title of the figure.
Thanks and Happy Learning :)
